BUILDING PRODUCTS TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
Elevating human potential in work, learning, sports, and health.
I specialize in transforming complex, cross-functional ideas into scalable, production-ready solutions. From AI developer tools and edge inference platforms to biosensors and brain-computer interfaces, my work lives at the intersection of human-centered design, deep tech, and strategic execution.
At Intel, I lead the productization of developer tools and parallel computing libraries to accelerate AI. Then I used AI to develop productivity tools to help product managers and developers thrive in the emerging AI-first workplace—reducing friction, amplifying output, and accelerating decision-making.
At Meta Reality Labs, I worked on AI-powered audio DSP for wearable devices. Our beamforming microphone algorithms enabled users to isolate and enhance voices in noisy environments—imagine clearly hearing a person several tables away in a crowded bar. It was a compelling example of how technology can expand the boundaries of human perception.
At NeuroSky, I built brainwave biosensors to decode mental states in real time. We delivered personalized education products that adjusted digital content based on student attention and mental fatigue. And peak mental performance training culminated in U.S. Archery team winning in the Olympic.
Across every role, I’ve led high-impact teams across hardware, AI, and software—delivering both 0→1 innovation and scaled to mass market. I bring a strong technical foundation, strategic clarity, and customer-first mindset to every mission.
